The Pomodoro Clock offers a time management technique that promotes productivity and concentration. By breaking work into focused intervals, typically 25 minutes in duration, followed by short breaks, our Pomodoro technique helps prevent burnout, improves task completion rates, and enhances overall efficiency. Integrating the Pomodoro Clock into our planner app enables users to structure their workday effectively, allocate time for specific tasks, and maintain a healthy work-life balance.

This application is designed with a button that triggers the timer when clicked. After the timer reaches its completion, a notification is promptly displayed to signify the end of the timer.
